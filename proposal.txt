Proposed Dataset: Census-Income (KDD) Data Set
UC-Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

Data Exploration
----------------

Initial analysis of a subset of the data will be conducted in R,
using various packages to implement the classification problem
presented (binary classification of observations into either
above or below $50,000 annual income). I expect to use ggplot2
to visualize the data, before beginning to attempt to build a
binary classifier for the data.

Since there are missing values in the dataset, ideally an
expectation-maximization algorithm will be implemented to fill
in the missing values. After finishing the task of filling in the
missing data, I would like to implement multiple classifiers
(possibly prepackaged in R) to see their relative efficacy.

Primarily, the classification algorithm that I would like to try
and implement will be a logit or probit model.

(Ideal) Final Results
---------------------

At the end of the quarter, I would like to have classifiers
coded in Python that run through the entirety of the dataset
(about 300,000 observations with 40 attributes). Ideally, I will
have control over the relative weights assigned to each of the
attributes. With the aid of parallel processing, I'd like to run
through as many possible combinations of weights on the attributes
as possible, hopefully coming up with a set of weights that
minimizes cross-validation error.

From these results, I would like to be able to ascertain the
predictive power of the various attributes presented in the
observations.

So in other words, the hypotheses I'd like to test are the
relevance of the various attributes in predicting a person's annual
income.
